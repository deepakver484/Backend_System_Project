* ### [Banking_System](https://github.com/deepakver484/Backend_System_Project/tree/main/Banking_System)

  The users_account system models a basic banking system. It consists of two tables: account_user and account_Transactions. The account_user table stores user information, including user_id, username, address, phone, password. The account_Transactions table records transactions with columns for Transaction_id, user_id, Deposite, Withdraw, transaction_datetime, and balance. This system enables users to perform transactions and maintains accurate account balances.
